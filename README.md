# Basketball Tactic Board

A react application that mimics a basketball tactic board where users can illustrate set plays by moving circles on a board into different positions, and saving them as frames.

## Disclaimer

This project uses AWS Amplify, DynamoDB, and Cognito for saving and retrieving the set plays, and for user authentication, respectively. However, these services have been disabled for this repository. As a result, the application will not be able to run, and the saved set plays, user authentication functionality, and the hosted UI for login and registration will not be accessible. The purpose of this repository is to showcase the use of AWS services, and not to provide a working application.

## Overview

This project was built using React and utilizes AWS Amplify, DynamoDB, and Cognito to provide a complete solution for creating and saving basketball set plays, and for user authentication. Despite the disabled services, the codebase serves as a demonstration of how these AWS services can be integrated into a react application.
